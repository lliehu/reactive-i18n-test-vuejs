# vuejs-reactive-i18n-test

## TODO

* Language switcher that shows correct status also when language is auto detected.
* Put translations somewhere else.
* Reactive retranslation when translation source changes.
* Test select component. There are usually some kind of problems with them.
* Insert a map.
* Be able to insert places to map and comment them.
* App message log (language switching also switches language of past messages)
